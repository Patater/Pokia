In order to build this project, you need a version of Java that can run the
Closure Compiler <https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/> and the
Closure Linter (gjslint) <https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/>
installed and in your path.

P.S. Sorry about the messy commit history. I was sloppy thinking I'd just
rebase it all later. But now I'm lazy, and the project is pretty much done, so
I'd rather do other things.
